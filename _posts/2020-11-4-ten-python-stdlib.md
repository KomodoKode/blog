This is a *very short* ~~blog post~~ list of 20 Python standard library modules (that I think) you **must know**.

In the next article, I will explain why I chose these 10.

NOTE: This doesn't mean you shouldn't learn the other modules. In fact, this list used to have **20** items.
I just tediously pickede ten with a general audience in mind.

Anyways, here's the list:

 * Pathlib
 * Re
 * Subprocess
 * Os
 * Argparse
 * Math
 * Asyncio
 * Random
 * Copy
 * Sys
