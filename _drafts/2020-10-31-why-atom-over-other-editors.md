Ever since this year, I've been using [Atom](https://atom.io/). It was now my favorite editor even though I had other choices.

### Before Atom

Before Atom, I've always used [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). Sublime Text had every thing I needed: beautiful themes (Monokai), Autocomplete (Jedi), and it was fast and usable. But, I've only used Sublime for single-file projects; never big ones. That was because there was one constraint. No, it's not that it didn't have Git integration: **it was not free**.

Not free to use legally, that is. Sure, there's the infamous indefinite free trial you can abuse, but that wouldn't be nice.

So I searched up "Sublime Text alternatives". Atom was the editor many sites recommend. [Slant.co](https://www.slant.co/options/40/alternatives/~sublime-text-alternatives) was one of them.

And so I used it. I love it! But first, what is Atom?

### What is Atom
 
Atom is

It's [open source](https://github.com/atom/atom), and built using [web technologies](https://electronjs.org/). This makes it *very* customizable.

How?

Well you see, there are millions of websites in the world. Whether it's a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) site, a [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) site, or even this [blog](https://thatxliner.github.io/blog), at some point there *has* to be [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/).
