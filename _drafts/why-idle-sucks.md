title: "Why IDLE sucks"

Lately, my friend has started learning Python (woohoo! :partying_face:). And he's doing pretty well. He got down most of the basics (I hope) but still is trying to grasp the syntax.

He's been getting syntax errors from his current editor: IDLE. Wait, what's IDLE?

### What is IDLE?

[IDLE][4] is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that ships with Python (the one from [python.org](https://www.python.org/), at least). IDLE stands for Integrated *Learning* Environment.

It's pretty simple: just some basic syntax highlighting (no [monokai][1] theme though), some autocomplete, find (and replace), parenthesis highlighting, [grep][2]ping support (no [re][3] though), a built-in python shell, and a built-in pizza delivery system (just kidding).

Intrested? Well, it isn't exactly beautiful. But I'd cut it some slack since it's built using [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).

Even if it's ~~good~~ decent for a beginner, I wouldn't recommend using it for the long term

### Alternatives

You must be kidding me: pretty much every editor out there is better than IDLE (at least, in my opinion).
